The experiment underscored the stochastic nature of radioactive decay and provided insights into the practical applications of radioactivity in medical, industrial, and research settings. Significant findings were the confirmation of the inverse square law for beta/gamma radiation from a Cs-137 source and the calculation of the half-life of Ba-137m.

	\section{Introduction}	

	Radioactivity involves the spontaneous emission of particles or electromagnetic waves from the unstable nuclei of certain atoms. These emissions, known as radiation, are a natural byproduct of unstable isotopes seeking stability through processes such as alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma emission. Radiation can be detected and quantified using instruments such as the Geiger-Müller (GM) tube, a device designed to measure ionizing radiation types including alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays.
	
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Intro_Radiation.jpg}
		\caption{Radiation types}
		\label{fig:Intro_Radiation}
	\end{figure}
	
	Radioactivity is quantified in two principal units: the Becquerel ($\unit{\becquerel}$) and the Curie ($\unit{Ci}$) \cite{manual}.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Becquerel ($\unit{\becquerel}$): The Becquerel is the SI unit of radioactivity. One Becquerel is defined as one disintegration per second. This unit directly measures the rate at which an unstable atomic nucleus transforms, emitting radiation in the process.
		\item Curie ($\unit{Ci}$): The Curie is an older, non-SI unit of radioactivity, still commonly used in some contexts, particularly within the United States. One Curie is approximately equal to \(3.7 \times 10^{10}\) disintegrations per second, defined historically based on the activity of one gram of radium-226.
	\end{itemize}
	
	The GM tube operates by using a gas-filled metal cylinder with a thin mica window that allows radiation to enter. Inside the tube, a high voltage is applied between the outer metal cylinder (cathode) and a central wire (anode). When radiation penetrates the tube, it ionizes the gas, creating ions and electrons. The electrons are attracted towards the anode, creating an ionization current that is detected as a count. This process is instrumental in understanding the intensity and type of radiation being measured. The efficiency of the GM tube is affected by factors such as the type of gas used, the pressure within the tube, and the voltage applied across the electrodes.
	
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Intro_GMTube_1.jpg}
		\caption{\centering Schematic of gas-filled detector operated with a varying voltage applied between the chamber wall (cathode) and a central collecting electrode (anode) \cite{martin_physics_2006}}
		\label{fig:Intro_GM_Tube}
	\end{figure}
	
	The interaction of radiation with matter is fundamentally probabilistic, described by exponential decay laws. The activity \( A \) of a radioactive sample, measured in disintegrations per second (or Becquerels), follows the equation:
	\begin{equation}
		A = A_0 e^{-\lambda t}
	\end{equation}
	where: \( A_0 \) is the initial activity, \( \lambda \) is the decay constant, \( t \) is the time elapsed. This is also equivalent to the number of radioactive atoms \( N \).
	
	In this lab report, we explore several aspects of radioactivity and its detection:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[1.] \textbf{Background Radiation Measurement}: Understanding and measuring the omnipresent background radiation is crucial for accurate radiation measurement.
		\item[2.] \textbf{Resolving Time}: This part examines the time after each detection during which the detector is 'blind' to further incoming radiation.
		\item[3.] \textbf{Geiger Tube Efficiency}: We investigate how efficiently the GM tube detects different types of radiation.
		\item[4.] \textbf{Inverse Square Law}: This part validates the principle that the intensity of radiation observed from a point source decreases inversely with the square of the distance from the source.
		\item[5.] \textbf{Range and Absorption}: We explore how different materials absorb or attenuate different types of radiation, providing insights into shielding and radiation protection.
	\end{enumerate}	
	This lab report is vital for several reasons. First, it enhances understanding of the fundamental principles of radioactivity and the practical application of radiation detection methods, particularly through the use of the Geiger-Müller (GM) tube. Such knowledge is crucial for fields ranging from medical diagnostics, where radioactive tracers are used in imaging, to environmental science, which often involves monitoring natural and anthropogenic radioactive sources.
	
	Second, this report contributes to safety in handling and using radioactive materials. By measuring background radiation and understanding the behavior of different radioactive sources under various conditions, we can better manage and mitigate the risks associated with radiation exposure. The manual’s discussion on exposure to radiation highlights the omnipresent nature of background radiation and the importance of quantifying this exposure accurately, especially in occupational settings such as nuclear plants and hospitals.
	
	Third, the experiments detailed in this report serve as practical examples of the inverse square law and radiation absorption principles, which are not only foundational concepts in physics but also critical in designing shielding and safety protocols to protect against harmful radiation.
	
	To sum up, the insights provided by this report have profound implications for health, safety, and the practical use of radiation in various technological and medical applications.

	The average resolving time for this tube is $\qty{4.50028e-6}{\second}$, and it falls withing the accepted $\qty{1}{\micro\second}$ to $\qty{100}{\micro\second}$ range. This value is used for further experiments wherever True cpm is calculated. The percent of correction is not the same for all values, ideally it should be consistent but because of inherent errors in the experiment the percentage varies. Some errors include
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Random Nature of Decay}: Radioactive decay is a stochastic process, meaning it is random by nature. The time between decay events is exponentially distributed, which can lead to variability in the number of disintegrations observed over a fixed time interval, even under identical experimental conditions.
		\item \textbf{Detector Efficiency Variability}: Geiger-Müller tubes can have slight variations in sensitivity and efficiency, even among tubes of the same model and make. These variations can affect how many events the tube detects, particularly during periods of high activity when multiple decays occur close together in time.
		\item \textbf{Experimental Setup}: Small differences in how the experiment is set up each time can influence results. This includes variations in source placement, environmental conditions (like temperature and humidity), and background radiation levels, all of which can affect the count rate.
		\item \textbf{Dead Time of the Detector}: The dead time (Resolving time) can vary slightly depending on the specific characteristics of the tube and the operating voltage. If the count rates are high, even small variations in dead time can significantly impact the percentage of counts added.

	The efficiency is very low indicating that not all the expected counts were counted. This is a given due to many factors: the activity of the sample decaying over time, the placement of the sample in the holder, environmental fluctuations, etc. The main factor is the expected cpm accounts for all the radiation emitting from a sample, not the fraction detected by the GM tube.

	We were able to take some reading less than $\qty{2}{\centi\meter}$ and this allows us to see the curve slope down over a certain interval of distances towards zero. This range indicates that not every identical particle will have identical energy loss because every particles goes through a different number of collisions. This phenomenon is called \textit{range straggling} and the mean range $\bar{R}$ can be used to approximate the energy of an alpha particle. The energy is approximated by $E \approx R + 1.5$, where $E$ is in $\unit{\mega\electronvolt}$ and $R$ is in $\unit{\centi\meter}$.

	The percent error is high indicating some inherent error in the experiment. Main source of error would be misalignment of the source and detector especially with this sample since alpha particles have very short range in air, any deviation can introduce error. The air density can fluctuate from temperature or pressure changes from nearby objects like humans, GM Tube, computers.

	For Figure 8, the drop-off in cpm is sharp initially and then flattens out, which is due to background radiation. Figure 9 is constructed by subtracting the average of the background from Lead and removing those reading, now it depicts a clear linear decay trend of ln(True cpm) with mass thickness, which is more consistent with the theoretical expectation for beta particle absorption. The linear trend line with a negative slope and a high \( R^2 \) value suggests a good fit to an exponential decay model, implying that the intensity of beta radiation decreases exponentially with the mass thickness of the absorber.

	The maximum energy of the beta particles is $\qty{0.546}{\unit{\mega\electronvolt}}$, the experimental measurement is found by setting the equation of the line to 0 and finding x. $x = \qty{1.3926e3}{\milli\gram\per\centi\meter\squared}$. Dividing this by 1000 to convert it to suitable units and inserting it into $E = 1.84R+0.212$, where $R$ is in $\unit{\gram\per\centi\meter\squared}$. $E = \qty{2.7743}{\mega\electronvolt}$. Clearly this is too far from the real value and this can be attributed to range strangling. I attempted to remove range straggling by not counting the lead readings from the graph. Even so, this indicates that range strangling occurs for aluminum, meaning the x-intercept must be between $\qty{129}{\\gram\per\centi\meter\squared}$ and $\qty{849}{\milli\gram\per\centi\meter\squared}$.

	The best fit line indicates the exponential nature of attenuation, where $I=I_0 e^{-\mu X}$, $\mu = \num{5e-5}$. With that we can find the half mass thickness $X_{1/2}$ by $I_0 /2 = I_0 e^{-\mu X_{1/2}}$.
	\[
		X_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(2)}{\num{5e-5}} = \qty{13863}{\milli\gram\per\centi\meter\squared}
	\]
	This is consistent with our data as no absorber has $265$ cpm, half of that is $133$ cpm and our readings reach $179$ cpm, so there is still more shielding needed to half the original cpm.

	The standard error comes from the regression analysis tables, and the standard deviations $\sigma$ are found by $SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ where n is the number of observations for that run. The real value of Ba-137m $t_{1/2}$ is $\qty{153}{\second}$ and the \# of $\sigma$'s is found by $\frac{\abs{Experimental - Real}}{\sigma_{t_{1/2}}}$. The best result from the three is the first half with a percent error of $3.47\%$. Initially one would think the whole data would give the best result but this indicates some inherent errors in the experiment. The relationship is exponential meaning that linear regression is not the best model. Also the inherent statistical variation of radiation is a major factor.

	\section{Conclusion}

	The series of experiments conducted provided a comprehensive understanding of several phenomena associated with radioactivity. The inverse square law was confirmed within an acceptable margin of error, demonstrating the predictable nature of radiation intensity as a function of distance from a source. The experiments involving the absorption of beta and gamma rays yielded results that were consistent with established physical laws, although the beta particle energy measurements indicated a need for further refinement in experimental technique.
	
	The half-life measurement for Ba-137m, while not entirely within the expected range, offered a practical exercise in the challenges of radiometric data collection and analysis. The observed percent error prompted a review of the data collection process, leading to improvements in both methodology and analytical precision.
	
	In summary, the experiments successfully demonstrated the core principles of radioactivity and its measurement, reinforcing theoretical knowledge with empirical data. The experience has shown the importance of experimental design and has provided valuable lessons in the interpretation of radiometric data.
