	\section{Introduction}	
	
	This comprehensive experiment incorporates Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) Analysis, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and Optical Profilometry to provide an in-depth characterization of material surfaces. These advanced techniques allow for the precise analysis of surface topography, structure, and composition, each contributing unique insights into the material properties at micro to nanometer scales.
	
	SEM and EDX represent cornerstone technologies in the field of material science, providing essential insights into the structural and compositional aspects of materials at the micro to nano scale. SEM operates on principles akin to optical microscopes but uses focused beams of electrons instead of light to achieve magnifications up to the sub-nanometer level, significantly surpassing the limitations of optical instruments.

		\caption{SEM Concept}
	\end{figure}
	
	The operation of SEM is based on the interactions between electron beams and the sample, producing various signals like secondary electrons (SE) and backscattered electrons (BSE), which help in imaging the surface topography and composition. The introduction of EDX into SEM extends its functionality by enabling elemental analysis. EDX works by detecting X-rays emitted from the sample when it is bombarded with electrons; these X-rays have energies characteristic of specific elements, thus allowing for precise compositional analysis. Together, they enable a detailed examination of surface morphology and chemical makeup, crucial for materials science, metallurgy, and semiconductor research.

	OP is a non-contact method that uses light to measure the topography of a surface, providing detailed 3D imaging and roughness measurements. This technique leverages the principles of optical interference, focus variation, confocal microscopy, and other light-based methods to generate accurate topographical data of the sample surface. It is distinguished by its ability to rapidly and accurately measure surface features across a wide range of scales, from nanometers to millimeters, without touching the sample. This makes it particularly valuable for sensitive or soft materials that could be damaged by contact methods. Common implementations include White Light Interferometry (WLI) and Confocal Microscopy, which are used to achieve high-resolution measurements of surface roughness, texture, and form.
	
	The technology operates on the principle of detecting the interference pattern created when light reflected from the sample surface combines with light from a reference beam. This interference pattern is analyzed to extract the surface's profile. Advanced techniques such as Phase Shifting Interferometry (PSI) and Vertical Scanning Interferometry (VSI) are used to enhance the measurement's precision and to cater to different types of surface characteristics.

	AFM, also known as Scanning Force Microscopy (SFM), is a type of scanning probe microscopy that provides detailed topographical mapping of surfaces at the nanometer scale. This powerful technique utilizes a sharp probe mounted on a flexible cantilever to interact with the surface of a sample. As the probe raster scans across the surface, it records minute force interactions between the tip and the surface, which are translated into electrical signals that can be used to construct a three-dimensional image of the surface.
	
	\begin{figure}[htbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Intro_AFM_1.jpg}
		\caption{AFM Concept}
	\end{figure}
	
	AFM is distinguished by its remarkable resolution, capable of detecting features at the fraction of a nanometer scale, far surpassing the optical diffraction limit. This high resolution enables the observation of individual atoms and molecules on a variety of surfaces, including polymers, ceramics, composites, and biological samples. Moreover, AFM is versatile in its environmental adaptability, allowing measurements to be conducted in various settings including air and liquid, making it indispensable for studying biological processes in their native environments.
	
	The technique is fundamentally driven by the interaction of forces including Van der Waals forces, electrostatic forces, and capillary forces, among others. These interactions help in not only determining the surface topography but also in measuring the mechanical, magnetic, and electrical properties of the sample surface.
	
	Through its multiple operational modes, such as contact mode, non-contact mode, and tapping mode, AFM provides a comprehensive suite of analysis options, catering to the specific needs of the research or industrial application at hand, from studying the surface roughness to functional properties like phase and modulus.

	The SEM images showcase the microstructure of the ZrC under the ZrO2 coating. The expected property is a uniform and continuous coating, and it is apparent from the smooth and homogeneous surface. Variations in depth and texture are observed which indicates areas where the coating might be too thin or non-uniform, potentially exposing the ZrC substrate. For the Cu sample, the SEM images show the quality of the laser etching. We observe well-defined edges and consistent depth of the engraving, which are crucial for applications like microcircuit fabrication or decorative finishes.
	EDX analysis helps confirm the chemical makeup of the ZrC-ZrO2 interface. Expected properties include a clear split of ZrO2 and ZrC layers with distinct peaks for Zr and O in the ZrO2 layer and C and Zr in the ZrC layer. The presence of unexpected elements like Al and Ca could suggest contamination or secondary phases that could affect the material's properties like electrical conductivity or corrosion resistance. Also on the Cu sample, we can see some oxidation from the O atoms and some C atoms, potentially from coating.

	The step height standard was used for calibration, ensuring the accuracy of height measurements across these samples. The profiler provided detailed 3D topographical maps that highlighted features such as the surface roughness of Al and Cu, the smoothness of Glass, and the details of the laser etching. Its clear that post processing is required due to the nature of the apparatus. The metals Cu and Al exhibit uniform and smooth surfaces even after manufacturing with only minimal surface roughness. For glass, we can see how flat the surface is before processing, and even after processing the variations are in the range of $\qty{0.01}{\micro\meter}$. The laser etched sample highlghts the preceision and repeatability of the applied etching process, as evident by the consistent depth and apparent pattern.

	\section{Conclusion}
		
	The integration of SEM, EDX, OP, and AFM in this experiment has effectively shown the surface characteristics of various materials. SEM and EDX analyses revealed the microstructural details and elemental composition of ZrC-ZrO2 and Cu, confirming the uniformity of coatings and the quality of laser etchings. OP provided quantitative data on surface roughness and topography, particularly highlighting the precision of surface treatments and manufacturing quality. AFM offered unparalleled insights into the nanoscale surface features of FTO-coated glass, showing minimal grain boundaries and surface roughness suitable for advanced optical applications. This study demonstrates the powerful synergy of combining multiple surface characterization techniques to obtain a comprehensive understanding of material surfaces, which is vital for the advancement of materials science and engineering.
